1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
Client: A client is a device, typically a computer or a mobile device, that requests or consumes resources or services from a server.
Server: A server is a computer or a system that receives, processes, and responds to client requests. It hosts and provides resources, services, or functionalities that clients can access.
In the HTTP protocol,the client sends requests and the server sends responses?

2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?
a route refers to a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) endpoint to which a server responds. 
It defines the combination of HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL path that a client can use to access or 
interact with a specific resource or functionality on the server.

a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
